I am software developer at Programming Research. Learning Linux Kernel, passionate about GNU/Linux and OSS, enjoying algorithms and data structures and coding in C and C++11.

### More Information

I am a software engineer that likes challenges when I am working in a project, that is because I really enjoy thinking about how to apply advanced algorithms and data structures to solve problems in an efficient and elegant way.

One of my favourites projects is the Linux Kernel. Currently, I am doing the Eudyptula challenge. Moreover, I am contributing in my spare time in few open source projects, such as Manjaro Linux.
